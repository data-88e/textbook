This format aligns with the axes of our plots, since quantity is on the x-axis and price is on the y-axis. However, it perhaps makes more sense to switch this around, expressing quantity demanded or supplied as a function of price.

    "\n",
    "In reality, the demand function is based on the price consumers pay (which we'll denote $P_c$), and the supply function is based on the price producers receive (which we'll denote $P_p$). Hence, the actual demand and supply functions are $D(P_c)$ and $S(P_p)$, so we should be equating:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the no-tax scenario, the price received by producers is the same as the price paid by consumers. Hence, we are able to get away by expressing them both as $P$ above, where $P=P_p=P_c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of tax, $P_p$ is no longer equal to $P_c$. Specifically, $P_p+\\text{tax}=P_c$. As a result, to solve for equilibrium with taxes, we can use substitution to express $P_c$ as $P_p+\\text{tax}$, or $P_p$ as $P_c−\\text{tax}$. Hence we actually aim to equate:\n",

    "Because there are now 3 unknowns ($P_c,P_p,Q$) and 3 equations ($P_p+\\text{tax}=P_c$, supply equation, and demand equation), we conduct this substitution to reduce it to 2 equations and 2 unknowns. Essentially, you'll find that the tax simply was just a shift in the intercepts, which matches our graphical intuition from the diagrams above!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are able to solve for $P_p$ or $P_c$, we can add/subtract the tax to get the other. We can also plug $P_c$ into $D(P_c)$ to get the equilibrium quantity, which should be the same as plugging in $P_p$ into $S(P_p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to calculate the consumer burden, we seek to measure how much more the consumers are now paying due to the tax. Hence, this value is $P_c−P$, where $P$ is the original price when there is no tax. Similarly, to calculate the producer burden, we seek to measure how much less the producers are now receiving due to the tax; this value is $P−P_p$. "
