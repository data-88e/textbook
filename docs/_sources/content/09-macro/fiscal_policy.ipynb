    "**There are many fiscal policy tools at the hands of the government to stabilize the economy. These primarily include changes to levels of taxation and government spending. To stimulate growth, taxes are lowered and government spending is increased, often involving borrowing through issuing government debt. To cool down an overheated economy, the government can use the opposite tools.** \n"

    "**Classical economics** claims economic fluctuations arise from “supply \n",
    "shocks'' such as fluctuations in productivity, and the aggregate supply is the determinant of economic output. So, the Classical view places little emphasis on the use of fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand. Classical theory is the basis for Monetarism, which only concentrates on managing the money supply, through monetary policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keynesian economics** suggests recessions often arise from “aggregate demand” shocks, and governments need to use fiscal policy, especially in a recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AD–AS diagram below, we can see a visual comparison between the economy under the Classical view and the Keynesian view. In the Classical view, the AS curve is vertical. So any increase or decrease in aggregate demand (such as government spending) will not affect the output. On the other hand, in the Keynesian view, increase or decrease in aggregate demand will result in a corresponding change in the output. \n"
